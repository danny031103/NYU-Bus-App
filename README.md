## Project Statement
The purpose of the NYU Bus App is to better display the schedule and arrival times for the free shuttles offered to the university community. These buses service different parts of the city and are often better suited for students than public transportation options. Many students are unaware of these buses or are forced to use the existing app which is difficult to read. This app aims to solve those issues.

## Specifications
Project written in swift for IOS devices. Pending publishing on App Store.
